    <h2 style="color: white">October 29, 2022 -- WHAT A HOOT</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawntel's uncle Derek, and his fiancee came over, and we watched the World Series game between the Astros and the Phillies. It was a hoot! A couple of times during the game, I led a cheer of "Who let the dogs out!" Also, when the game ended, with the Astros winning 5-2, I said "Cinco-dos, adios!" Debbie, who is part hispanic, liked that too. Also, after the game, Shawntel was talking on the phone with her dad (Derek's brother), and he was talking about having to sing his girlfriend to sleep. I started imitating Shawntel's mom whenever she talks to either of her great-grandchildred, singing "Rock-a-bye baby, in a treetop..." Shawntel and I both got a big hoot out of that.</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: #00ffff">August 6, 2022 -- STANDING OVATION AT KARAOKE</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Mo' Ranch, I sang "Piano Man" karaoke, and I was blown away by the response I got. Even the young kids were singing along to the song and dancing. So many of them were singing that I allowed them to sing the second chorus. At the end, I got a standing ovation for my performance. It was one of the best reactions I'd ever gotten from singing karaoke.</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: #ff0080">July 14, 2013 -- THE PERFECT CONNECTION</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A real strong connection that was building over a week of great phone conversations. came to real fruition when I finally met Shawntel Monroe. Her size didn't matter, for she and I clicked immediately. We held each other tightly immediately, and in fact, almost had sex immediately after we got inside the hotel room. But we decided to wait until after we went swimming. But we were still caressing, kissing, and hugging each other in the pool, and after a while, we decided to go back to the room. There, we finally did make love, and it was BEAUTIFUL! Everything just felt SO right. We held each other in each other's arms afterwards, and talked for hours. We both knew by the end of that date, that something magical had started between the two of us.</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: #ff0080">August 14, 2011 -- SKINNY-DIP</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Sandy Warfield, turning 53 in a week, came over, and we went for a late-night swim in the giant pool behind the rental office. I swam naked right away, but it took a little time to get Sandy out of her swimsuit. But once she was out of her swimsuit, she loved swimming naked too. We soon started making out in the pool, and eventually, we had sex in the pool standing up. That was awesome!</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: #0000ff">August 5, 2006 -- GRADE A KISS</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a bus in Escondido, just leaving a huge transfer station, Kim (not the same one from the 6/13/1983 entry) shared a most passionate sensual kiss. Probably the best kiss I've gotten up to that point.</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: #00ffff">January 3, 2006 -- COME SWIM WITH ME</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alma, a cute 45-year-old mexican woman whom I'd previously met, I met again in the sauna. We talked for a while, then I told her that I was about to go swimming, and asked if she'd like to join me. She said yes. So we were in the pool, and was walking backwards toward five feet of water. Alma said that she was short, and I outstretched my hands, offerong to pull her along, but instear, she swam into my arms, put hers around me, and then we started kissing, caressing, and groping each other. This lasted for at least two hours.</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: #ffd800">December 8, 2001 -- FAVORITE GAMBLING MOMENT</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite gambling moment occurrec at the Monte Carlo casino at about 9:30 at night. I had just made up for a $100 loss at a previous craps table, and was handed the dice, and was asked if I wanted to shoot. Since I was slightly ahead at that point, I decided, why not? That's when it happened! I kept rolling the dice, on what was easily the longest shoot I'd ever had up to that point. I kept hitting those Place bets, and raising my bets every once in a while. But the best part of it, was, there were at least a dozen people gathered around the craps table, and each one was cheering my every roll of the dice. As I shook up the dice in my habd, they'd be yelling "Come on, shooter!" And after I'd roll the dice, they'd cheer even louder, bo matter what I rolled, as long as it wasn't a 7. After I did crap out, I got quite an ovation. The pit boss said I held onto the dice for 40 minutes. I made $1550 at that table alone, and had an overall win of $1565.</i></p>
    <P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, that was my biggest win. Although I'd later win more than that 9Â½ months later, this is still my all-time favorite gambling moment, for I'd never gotten such an ovation before (with the possible exception of when I'd bowled a perfect game in league).</I></P>

    <h2 style="color: #008080">September 22, 2000 -- LEAGUE PERFECTION</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my third and final game that night in league. Somehow, I'd gotten up to 11 strikes in a row, and bowled the last ball. From start to finish, there was little doubt about where this ball was going. And that 12th and final strike was the most solid of all the strikes in that game. And when I got that final strike, the whole alley ERUPTED in loud cheering for me bowling a perfect 300 game!!!!</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: #ff0080">October 23, 1999 -- A HAND UP THE SKIRT</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a date with Laverne that night, where she wore a semi-short skirt. We were getting kind of frisky in the car as I was driving, but in the process, I was able to slip a hand up her skirt, and felt nothing but bare booty. That felt nice.</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: #ff0000">June 13, 1983 -- A GREAT DATE</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a real romantic date with a sexy older woman named Kim Mayfield. She wore a sexy summer dress. We rode bikes from Foster's Freeze out to a park on Foothill Expressway near San Antonio Road. We had great conversations, and it lef to our making out in the park. I never had anyone kiss me the way Kim did. It felt great! I just wish I could have taken things further.</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: white">Summer, 1982 -- SPLIT CONVERTER</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was having a real good day bowling in my summer league, including bowling a 210. But the highlight of this day seemed to be my split converting. I first converted a 3-10 split, then later a 3-7 split. Apparently, my bowling was driving this one girl on the opposing team so crazy that she said when I left the 6-7 split (a 1 in 10 shot for the pros), "Try to make THAT split!" When I did (much to my surprise as well), I yelled back at that girl "WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY?!!"</i></p>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For good measure, later, when I was getting my ball, and about to step up to the approach, this same smart-ass girl had just made a spare, and said "Try to top THAT, smarty-pants." I promptly got a strike, and said to her "I think I did."</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: #8080ff">November 18, 1981 -- FIRST ROMANTIC MOMENT</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day just after school, Kathy and I rode our bikes to a secluded spot behind some bushes, where we each said that we like each other more than friends. It didn't dawn on me at first, but then it did, and at that point, I took Kathy into my arms, and she hugged me. This lasted for quite a while, and it was my first romantic moment.</i></p>

    <h2 style="color: white">Early 1978 -- BALLERINA IN THE POOL</h2>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in the pool at Lincoln Junior High. This day, I was in the shallow end, and this beautiful busty girl in a white bikini named Heather Heinemann was talking with me. She was dancing around and around like a ballerina, making sure I noticed. At one point, I had an arm outstretched on a ledge, and Heather came in kind of close. If I only was open to a romance with her. But I was only 12 years old, not quite 13, and girls weren't on my mind. But it still is a nice moment to look back on.</i></p>
